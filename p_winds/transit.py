    Calculate a normalized transit map. Additionally, calculate two-dimensional
    arrays of density and line-of-sight radial velocities around the planet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    planet_to_star_ratio (``float``):
        Ratio between the radii of the planet and the star.

    planet_physical_radius (``float``):
        Physical radius of the planet in whatever unit you want to work with.

    impact_parameter (``float``, optional):
        Transit impact parameter of the planet (not the atmosphere). Default is
        0.0.

    phase (``float``, optional):
        Phase of the transit. -0.5, 0.0, and +0.5 correspond to the center of
        planet being located at, respectively, the left limb of the star, the
        center, and the right limb. Default is 0.0.

    grid_size (``int``, optional):
        Size of the transit grid. Default is 100.

    supersampling (``float`` or ``None``, optional):
        In order to avoid pixels with hard edges, it is useful to first compute
        the transit grid at a high resolution and then downscale it to a
        manageable grid size. Supersampling is the factor by which to increase
        the grid size at first and then downscale to the requested grid size. If
        ``None``, no supersampling is applied. Default is ``None``.

    resample_method (``str`` or ``None``, optional):
        Method by which to resample the image if supersampling is used. If
        ``None``, then fallback to a "box" method. Available methods are
        ``"nearest"``, ``"box"``, ``"bilinear"``, ``"hamming"`` and
        ``"lanczos"`` (the last two are not recommended for research-grade
        results. Default is ``None``.

    limb_darkening_law (``None`` or ``str``, optional):
        String with the name of the limb-darkening law. The options are the same
        currently implemented in the code ``flatstar``: ``'linear'``,
        ``'quadratic'``, ``'square-root'``, ``'log'``, ``'exp'``, ``'s3'``,
        ``'c4'``, or ``None`` (no limb-darkening). Default is ``None``.

    ld_coefficient (``float`` or ``array-like``):
        In case of a linear limb-darkening law, the value of the coefficient
        should be a float. In all other options it should be array-like. Default
        is ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    normalized_intensity_map (``numpy.ndarray``):
        2-D map of intensity normalized in such a way that the sum of the array
        will be 1.0 if the planet is not transiting.

    transit_depth (``float``):
        Absorption caused by the opaque disk of the planet in the specified
        transit configuration.

    r_from_planet (``numpy.ndarray``):
        2-D map of radial distances of each pixel from the center of the planet
        in the same unit as ``planet_physical_radius``.

        2-D map of radial distances of each pixel from the center of the planet.
        The unit has to be consistent with the other input parameters. E.g., if
        you use unit of meters, all other input parameters with length in the
        unit also have to be in meters.

    radius_profile (``numpy.ndarray``):
        1-D profile of radii in which the densities are sampled. Unit has to be

        is to be calculated, then input this parameter as an array-like object.

    oscillator_strength (``float``):
        Oscillator strength of the transition. The format or shape of this input
        parameter needs to be consistent with that of ``central_wavelength``.

        Gaussian term of the Voigt profile with an additive factor proportional
        to the square of the density-averaged, line-of-sight velocity (faster).

    z_grid_size (``int``, optional):
        Grid size for the line of sight direction. This is used only if
        ``wind_broadening_method`` is set to ``'formal'``. Default is 200.
